# Test files

This folder contains multiple data sets, plots and configuration files gathered and used during our tbed testing operations. 

These tests include:
- TCP window size comparison
- different MTU values
- UDP vs TCP bandwidth comparison
- Calico vs hostnetwork performance

The testing and plotting configuration files were created by Filip Katulski <filip.katulski@cern.ch> and are following the Autotester patterns described in the [main README](../README.md) file.
